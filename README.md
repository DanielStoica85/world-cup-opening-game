---

This is a techinical challenge to test Frontend development-related skills.

We provide a set of `.json` files with some statistics of the opening game of FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia. Use
it to build an application to visualize this data in a human readable format. Images of both country flags 
are also provided under the `assets/` directory.


## Requirements

* The final game score has to be shown next to each corresponding team flag.
* Clicking the team's name/flag should display a detailed view of all its match stats
* Show a timeline of all match events _including scores_ and assistances. 
* Substitutions must be presented as a single event in the timeline.
* It must include JavaScript unit tests
* Add an optimized production-ready build of the application with `npm run build`.

### Delivering the project
* Publish the project on a _private_ Git repository using any service you like (i.e.: GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket, etc)
* The project **MUST** be fully reproducible with a built-in development server after running the following sequence of commands:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
